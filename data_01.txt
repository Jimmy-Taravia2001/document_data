what do we want ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Elasticsearch is the place where all the Log data is stored. and retrieve them from kabana.

INDEXER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Certificate creation in wazuh indexer installation:
wazuh-certs-tool.sh (script) [ # curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/wazuh-certs-tool.sh ]
config.yml (configuration file)[  # -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/config.yml ]
both these things create certificates which encrypt communication between wazuh central components.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Installation using bitvise ssh or mobaxterm 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: type all commands because in puTTy session timeout occurs and is not feasible.

WAZUH INDEXER

First of all curl maybe absent in the terminal or os so first download curl. By following : 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl

Then finally install .sh file and .yml that is configuration file using the below commands:

curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/wazuh-certs-tool.sh
 To check use the ls command and the output to ls command should be: 
wazuh-certs-tool.sh

Then run command for configuaring the file:  
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.3/config.yml

Again to check run ls command: and output should be:  
config.yml    wazuh-certs–tool.sh 


Then to edit config file: we use vi command in linux so down below command should be typed: ( For error to edit the config.yml file use this link: https://success.trendmicro.com/dcx/s/solution/1113864-editing-configuration-files-of-linux-based-products?language=en_US )
vi config.yml


[Do not use vi but use sudo nano config.yml ]



Now, you have to change the ip address of nodes of indexer, server, dashboard with the one that was provided by office as the host ip address: (here ip address is  172.17.14.33)

You can then use 
wq! command to save and quit the file   (according to amazon ec2)

Now run the shell script that we installed with config file by using below command: 

bash ./wazuh-certs-tool.sh -A

After this check the status by typing ls command and output should be : 
wazuh-certificates   wazuh-certs-tool.sh


Now check all certificate present or not with: 
cd wazuh-certificates/
And then type ls command and output will be : all different types of certificates like admin-key.pem    admin.pem   dashboard-key.pem    dashboard.pem  etc. etc.
Now after checking go back by typing command:


cd .. 

Now further go int o the process and type the command below: 
tar -cvf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C ./wazuh-certificates/ . 
This above command is creation of a tar file of wazuh certifiactes

And now the next command is to type : 
rm -rf ./wazuh-certificates

Now again type ls command and the output should be : 
config.yml      wazuh-certificates.tar  wazuh-certs–tool.sh


Install the node packages if missing: 
sudo apt-get install debconf adduser procps


NODES  Installation: 
We have to use APT option commands not YUM commands because YUM is in Fedora

So start typing this command first: Note: type sudo before this commmand
apt-get -y install wazuh-indexer

Now as per the youtube video we already have downloaded dependencies so we further go ahed and add the key (GPG key) by using the following command:
Note: also here type sudo before  
curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg --import && chmod 644 /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg 

But you will get will get error here: that command can only be used by sudo: 

So here we type command first :
 sudo su root 

Then the command: 
sudo curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring gnupg-ring:/usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg --import && chmod 644 /usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg 

OR
sudo curl -s https://packages.wazuh.com/key/GPG-KEY-WAZUH | apt-key add -

Output will be:
 Ok

Now is the time to add the repository: so type the command below:

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/wazuh.gpg] https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/ stable main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wazuh.list

Output will be : 
Deb https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt//stable/ main


Now use the below command to update the package information:
apt-get update 



Now is the timme to install the WAZUH INSTALLER:
Type the following command: 
apt-get -y install wazuh-indexer

NOTE: it will take time as it is heavy package

Now to open the config file as shown in website (https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-indexer/step-by-step.html )
Type the following command but ass sudo first so we type:

sudo vi /etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch.yml

Now edit the file by changing the network-host value with the value that the ip address provided by office: so that ssl certificate is created
NOTE: wee are not creating cluster here so we will not provide ip addresses  to multiple nodes

After that you can type the 
wq! command to save and quit





NOW:
Type the command:
NODE_NAME=node-1
NOTE: here node-1 is originally our node-1 name already there so .

After this run these commands: 

mkdir /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs

tar -xf ./wazuh-certificates.tar -C /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/ ./$NODE_NAME.pem ./$NODE_NAME-key.pem ./admin.pem ./admin-key.pem ./root-ca.pem

mv -n /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/$NODE_NAME.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/indexer.pem

mv -n /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/$NODE_NAME-key.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/indexer-key.pem

chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs

chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/*

chown -R wazuh-indexer:wazuh-indexer /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs




After all this type ls command to check status and output will be:  
wazuh-certificates.tar   wazuh-certs-tool.sh 

Now you can check the files available in wazuh-indexer folder: type the following command next: 

cd /etc/wazuh-indexer/

And then type the command ls: output will be: 
certs    jvm.options   jvm.options.d    log4j2.properties etc. etc.  

Then type: 
cd certs/
Type ls command and output will be : 
admin-key.pem   admin.pem   indexer-key.pem  indexer.pem   root-ca.pem



So all is good now then type cd command and then lets go further


Now type the following command:

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-indexer
systemctl start wazuh-indexer
 

Here the 2nd command is used so that whenever we start this instance we do not need to turn on or power on the wazuh-indexer it will start automatically as enable command is used

NOTE: 
—---------
DO not run this below 3 linnes as they are not required but are just for checking purpose:

After this you can check the status of the service by typing the command:
systemctl statust wazuh-indexer
Output should be active and running process:
—---------

Now type the command:
/usr/share/wazuh-indexer/bin/indexer-security-init.sh

It will show connecting to ip address(of the office will be shown there)...

And finally Done with success

Wazuh indexer is installed successfully.
Finally to check whether it is working correctly type the below command:
curl -k -u admin:admin https://<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP>:9200/_cat/nodes?v

<WAZUH_INDEXER_IP> = 172.17.14.33 (your ip address)
